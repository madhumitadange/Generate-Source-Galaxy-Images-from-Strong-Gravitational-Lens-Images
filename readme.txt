1. Data Augmentation Notebook has code to simulate gravitational lensing images using randomly generated lentratronamy parameters and data preprocessing  . Test/Dev/ train split.   
2. Part 1 has code to predict gravitational lensing parameters using ConvNet 
3. Part 2 has U-Net code for generating source galaxy images using a custom loss function.
